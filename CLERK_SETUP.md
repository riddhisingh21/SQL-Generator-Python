# Clerk Authentication Setup Guide

Your SQL Generator now includes Clerk authentication with separate pages for history and schema management!

## 1. Create a Clerk Account

1. Go to [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Create a new application
4. Choose your preferred authentication methods (email, Google, GitHub, etc.)

## 2. Get Your Publishable Key

1. In your Clerk dashboard, go to "API Keys"
2. Copy the "Publishable Key"
3. Open the `.env` file in your project root
4. Replace `your_clerk_publishable_key_here` with your actual key:
   ```
   VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_actual_key_here
   ```

## 3. Configure Authentication Methods

In your Clerk dashboard:
1. Go to "User & Authentication" ‚Üí "Email, Phone, Username"
2. Enable your preferred sign-in methods
3. Configure social providers if desired (Google, GitHub, etc.)

## 4. Restart Your Development Server

After updating the `.env` file:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## 5. Test the Authentication
